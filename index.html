    <p>
        <b>Impotance of Neem tree:</b>
        Neem, (Azadirachta indica), fast-growing tree of the mahogany family (Meliaceae), valued as a medicinal plant,
        as a source of organic pesticides, and for its timber. Neem is likely native to the Indian subcontinent and to
        dry areas throughout South Asia. It has been introduced to parts of Africa, the Caribbean, and numerous counties
        in South and Central America. The plant has long been used in Ayurvedic and folk medicine and is used in
        cosmetics and in organic farming applications.
        <span id="moreContent1">Neem trees can reach 15–30 metres (49–98 feet) in height and have attractive rounded
            crowns and thick furrowed bark. The compound leaves have toothed leaflets and are typically evergreen but do
            drop during periods of extreme drought. The small fragrant white flowers are bisexual or staminate (male)
            and are borne in clusters in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a smooth yellow-green drupe and has a
            sweet-flavoured pulp.</span>

        <b>Impotance of Ocean:</b>
        Why are our oceans important? It’s a valid question. Afterall, humans live on land…so why should we care about
        the health of our oceans and seas?
        Besides the fact that oceans are home to countless marine species, they also greatly contribute to the health of
        animals that live on land and provide many benefits to humans. According to the National Ocean Service, the
        ocean produces more than 50 percent of the planet’s oxygen and it regulates our climate and weather patterns. We
        also rely on the ocean to transport goods, and it contributes to the worldwide economy through tourism, food,
        and other industries. Not to mention, communities across the globe rely on fish for protein and ocean
        ingredients used to make modern medicine.
        <span id="moreContent2">
            Despite all of these incredible benefits, climate change and human impacts are causing our oceans’ health to
            rapidly diminish and deteriorate. That’s why we, at CORAL, are calling on you to help us protect the ocean
            this World Oceans Day.
